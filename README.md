# Learning Objectives

- Showcase IBM Edge Capabilities to manage both edge servers and devices
- Position IEC for managing different types of workloads:
    e.g. analytics (AI) and business logicÂ  or middleware (Istio/Kafka, etc)
- Inspire the audience to think of potential use-cases in their industries

# Some Advice

This lab guide is not designed to be a `cut` and `paste` exercise. If this is what you do, then the learning value will be limited. Please use the short time you have to read, think and discuss with your colleagues so that you are ready for what is to come.

Have fun!

**Be patient!**

There is some latency in these labs, be patient and allow time for your changes to come into effect.

1. If you Edge Hub GUI goes blank, then go `Hamburger menu` > `Edge Computing`
2. Use `unique` names for your services, nodes and policies as we are working in a multi tenant environment.

**Do this now!**

Start both of your SkyTap VMs now to allow them to initialise.
